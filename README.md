# autonomous-smart-car
A car with 4 motors and a usb camera that can move on its own and send video/audio data through a web interface, powered by the Raspberry Pi5.

To do:
I have to move it Fast API
Play around with the styling, maybe setting audio to 48 KHz, add a button to cancel audio
Put stats for CPU usage and style it
Put 10 ohm resistor and design new chassis
